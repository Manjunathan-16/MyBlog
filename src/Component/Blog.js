          Hello everyone, I'm Manjunathan, and I'd like to share a bit about my
          educational and professional journey with you. I completed a total of
          16 years of education, including my undergraduate studies, in the
          vibrant city of Bangalore. My undergraduate degree was in Electrical
          and Electronics Engineering, and I pursued it at Acharya Institute of
          Technology. During my final year of college, I received an exciting
          opportunity to join Infosys, one of the leading IT companies in India.
          However, due to the unforeseen challenges posed by the COVID-19
          pandemic, my college completion was delayed by a couple of months, and
          this, in turn, affected my joining date. I officially became a part of
          the Infosys family on May 3rd, 2021. My training at Infosys was unique
          as it took place in a work-from-home (WFH) setting. During this
          period, I gained valuable skills in Java, Spring Boot, and React.js,
          which are integral in the world of software development. My training
          journey came to an end on September 8th, 2021, and I was eager to
          embark on the next phase of my career. Shortly after completing my
          training, I was placed in a Cisco project where I am responsible for
          managing two significant projects: "Simple Upgrade" and "Prime
          Collaboration Deployment." In this role, I primarily work with Java
          and JavaScript to develop and maintain these projects. I'm excited
          about the opportunities that lie ahead and the contributions I can
          make in the field of software development. Thank you for taking the
          time to learn a little bit about my background and experiences.
